  <p class="text">This is a web application that takes a user's birthday and calculates the day of the
                    week they were born and then depending on their gender outputs their Akan Name. Akan names are
                    derived from Ghanian culture. Frequently in Ghana, children are given their first name as a 'day
                    name' which corresponds to the day in the week they were born.</p>
